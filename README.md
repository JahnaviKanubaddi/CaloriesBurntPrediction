# 🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction
The Calories Burnt Prediction Project is a data science and web development initiative aimed at helping users estimate how many calories they burn during physical activity based on personal attributes and workout details.

**🎯 Objective**
To build a machine learning model that predicts the number of calories burned using inputs like age, gender, height, weight, duration of activity, etc., and to deploy it using a Flask web app.

**🧠 Key Steps Involved**
1 . Data Collection & Preprocessing
  -- Used a structured dataset with user metrics and calories burnt data.

  -- Cleaned and normalized data using pandas for better model performance.

2 . Model Training
  -- Applied machine learning algorithms such as:

        🔸 Linear Regression

        🔸 Random Forest Regressor

        🔸 Decision Tree
  -- Evaluated models based on accuracy, RMSE, and R² scores.

  -- Chose the best-performing model for deployment.
  
3 . Web App Development
  -- Developed a web interface using Flask, where users input their data.

  -- Backend takes user inputs, passes them to the ML model, and returns predicted calories.

  -- Designed a simple and user-friendly UI using HTML/CSS.

4 . Testing & Demo

  -- Successfully tested the app locally.

  -- Recorded a demo video due to Flask limitations on GitHub.
